Description and Warning:


Description:

The HAAR cascade components are used in Face Detect, where they decide what constitutes a head and eyes.

You can test this by drawing a simple face on a piece of paper. If it's not realistic enough, it will actually not be detected.

Warning:

Do not attempt to change the path to the components without simultaneously altering the relavent code in HeadPoseVtry.
